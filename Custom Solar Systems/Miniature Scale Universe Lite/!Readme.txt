RSSS Version 0.1
June 8, 2024

Normal mode is true scale. Hard and realistic are harder versions if you want to make getting to the moon impossible without part mods. Try it.

Note:

This version is very rudimentary and lacks several important objects that will be added later. The older version had these objects but they were lazily added and looked odd. These objects will be coming back in a better form later.

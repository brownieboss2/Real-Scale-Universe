# RSU Version 0.1


Normal mode is true scale. Hard and realistic are harder versions if you want to make getting to the moon impossible without part mods. Try it.


# Credits:


Most of the work done by me

Most atmosphere textures by the Actually Complete Solar System mod


# Note:


This version is very rudimentary and lacks several important objects that will be added later. The older version had these objects but they were lazily added and looked odd. These objects will be coming back in a better form later.

# About RSU

Real Scale Universe (RSU) is a mod for the game Spaceflight Simulator (SFS) that aims to add a more challenging and realistic experience to SFS.

The mod is a succesor of the old Real Scale Solar System mod (RSSS) that I made in 2022, which added every planet, named moon, dwarf planet, and several asteroids to the base game. The mod was released on another website and became the most popular planet pack on that site without crediting me whatsoever. This mod aims to do everything that mod could do but better, including add other stars, and as such I am spacing out the release of all of the bodies instead of releasing all of them at once, so that I can perfect the bodies before releasing them to the public.

# Note:


This version is very rudimentary and lacks several important objects that will be added later. The older version had these objects but they were lazily added and looked odd. These objects will be coming back in a better form later.
